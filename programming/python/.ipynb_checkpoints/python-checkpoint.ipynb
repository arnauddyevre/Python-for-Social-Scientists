    "\n",
    "#### 1.1. What is Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level and dynamic programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike C/C++, Java, R and many other programming languages, Python is designed to be easy to read, write and understand. It is free, and open source, which has contributed to its wide adoption in tech companies and in academia. Python's versatility has made it an industry standard in machine learning, data management & processing, web development, scripting, and finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2. Why do we choose Python\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simplicity**: Python code is designed to be as simple and intuitive as the pseudo code.\n",
    "* **Popularity**: Python is the most popular programming language in the data analysis and machine learning community. See below a graph of trends in requirements among job adverts for data scientists over time.\n",
    "* **Community support**: As a result of its popularity, Python is now extremely well supported and extensively documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ranking](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/resource/BLOGS_UPLOADED_IMAGES/trends0.png)\n",
    "*Graph from [IBM blogs](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/roller-ui/homepage?lang=en)*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3. Zen of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection of 19 aphorisms embodies the guiding principles that made Python a popular porogramming language: the \"Zen of Python\". The Zen of Python was originally written by Tim Peters and lives in PEP20. It is good to keep these in mind when writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Beautiful is better than ugly. \n",
    "* Explicit is better than implicit. \n",
    "* Simple is better than complex. \n",
    "* Complex is better than complicated. \n",
    "* Flat is better than nested. \n",
    "* Sparse is better than dense. \n",
    "* Readability counts. \n",
    "* Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. \n",
    "* Although practicality beats purity. \n",
    "* Errors should never pass silently. \n",
    "* Unless explicitly silenced. \n",
    "* In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. \n",
    "* There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. \n",
    "* Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. \n",
    "* Now is better than never. \n",
    "* Although never is often better than *right* now. \n",
    "* If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. \n",
    "* If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. \n",
    "* Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!\n"

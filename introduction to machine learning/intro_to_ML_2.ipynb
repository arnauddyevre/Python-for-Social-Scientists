    "# Introduction to machine learning II: Titanic survival prediction challenge\n",

    "Friday, September 27\n",
    "\n",
    "In this second machine learning Notebook, we will apply several ML algorithms to tackle a popular data science challenge: [\"Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster\"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview). This competition has been created by Kaggle, a community of data scientists, specialised in Machine Learning education (now owned by Google/Alphabet).\n",
    "In this particular challenge, competitors are asked to predict the survivial probability of each passengers aboard the Titanic, given their biographic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also use it to review some of data handling methods we have covered earlier.\n",

    "#### 1.1. Historical background\n",
    "\n",
    "The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2. The statistical problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Notebook we will apply several different machine learning algorithms to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\n",
    "We will use features on passenger's classes, names, gender, age, cabin, number of siblings/spouse aboard the ship, number of parents/children aboard the ship, ticket fare, port of embarkation. Based on these covariates, we will compare the different algorithms' performances.\n",

    "#### 3.1. The 4 C's of Data Cleaning: Correcting, Completing, Creating, and Converting**\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, we will clean our data by 1) correcting aberrant values and outliers, 2) completing missing information, 3) creating new features for analysis, and 4) converting fields to the correct format for calculations and presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Correcting:** Reviewing the data, there does not appear to be any aberrant or non-acceptable data inputs. In addition, we see we may have potential outliers in age and fare. However, since they are reasonable values, we will wait until after we complete our exploratory analysis to determine if we should include or exclude from the dataset. It should be noted, that if they were unreasonable values, for example age = 800 instead of 80, then it's probably a safe decision to fix now. However, we want to use caution when we modify data from its original value, because it may be necessary to create an accurate model.\n",
    "2. **Completing:** There are two common methods, either delete the record or populate the missing value using a reasonable input. It is not recommended to delete the record, especially a large percentage of records, unless it truly represents an incomplete record. Instead, it's best to impute missing values. A basic methodology for qualitative data is impute using mode. A basic methodology for quantitative data is impute using mean, median, or mean + randomized standard deviation.\n",
    "3. **Creating:**  Feature engineering is when we use existing features to create new features to determine if they provide new signals to predict our outcome. For this dataset, we will create a title feature to determine if it played a role in survival.\n",
    "4. **Converting:** Last, but certainly not least, we'll deal with formatting. There are no date or currency formats, but datatype formats. Our categorical data imported as objects, which makes it difficult for mathematical calculations. For this dataset, we will convert object datatypes to categorical dummy variables."
